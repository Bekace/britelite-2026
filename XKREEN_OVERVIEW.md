# Xkreen — Digital Signage CMS Overview

## What It Is

Xkreen (formerly Pointer) is a cloud-based digital signage CMS that lets businesses upload media, build playlists, schedule content, and push it to physical or web-based screens in real time. It is a multi-tenant SaaS with subscription billing, role-based access, and a remote-paired screen player.

## Core Features

### Content Management
- **Media Library** — upload images, videos, and URL-based media to GCS; stored with metadata (name, mime type, file size, GCS path) in the `media` table
- **Playlists** — ordered collections of media items with per-item duration, transition type/duration, and shuffle support (`playlists` + `playlist_items`)
- **Schedules** — time-based rules that assign playlists to screens on a recurring basis (`schedules` + `schedule_items`)

### Screen Management
- **Screens** — each screen has a unique pairing code (e.g. `QNYZW`), resolution, orientation, and location assignment
- **Screen Pairing** — an Android player (or web browser at `/player/[deviceCode]`) displays a code; the user enters it in the dashboard to link the screen to their account
- **Content Assignment** — screens can be assigned a playlist or individual media directly; the player polls `/api/devices/config/[deviceCode]` to get its current content

### Web Player (`/player/[deviceCode]`)
- Runs in any browser (or embedded in Android WebView)
- Polls `/api/devices/config/[deviceCode]` every 30 seconds for content updates
- Plays images and videos in sequence with configurable durations and fade transitions
- Images/iframes use a countdown timer; videos use native `onEnded` to advance
- Dual-buffer A/B element switching for seamless transitions
- Sends `device_events` (heartbeat, proof-of-play) back to the API

### Android Player Integration
- The Android app opens a WebView pointing to `https://app.xkreen.com/player/[deviceCode]`
- The pairing code is either hardcoded in the app or displayed on first launch
- Config polling, content playback, and event reporting all happen through the same web APIs — no separate Android SDK required
- `device_events` table records heartbeat pings and play events used for analytics and "Last Seen" timestamps

### User Accounts & Multi-Tenancy
- Each user has a `profiles` row (display name, company, avatar stored in GCS, Stripe customer ID)
- All data is scoped by `user_id` with Row Level Security (RLS) enforced at the DB level
- **Team Members** — users can invite teammates (`team_members` table); role-based (owner/member)
- **Locations** — screens can be grouped by physical location (`locations`, `screen_locations`)

## Subscription & Billing

### Plans
Three tiers stored in `subscription_plans`: **Free**, **Pro**, **Enterprise**.  
All plans include **1 free screen**. Additional screens are **purchased slots at $6/month each**.

### How It Works
1. User selects a plan → Stripe Checkout session created
2. After payment → `checkout.session.completed` webhook fires → user account created (new signup) or subscription upgraded (existing user)
3. On upgrade, `purchased_screen_slots` incremented by 1 in `user_subscriptions`
4. Screen limit = `free_screens + purchased_screen_slots - current_screen_count`
5. Adding a screen beyond the limit triggers a Stripe Checkout for an additional slot

### Key Tables
| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `subscription_plans` | Plan definitions (name, free_screens, max_screens) |
| `subscription_prices` | Stripe price IDs per plan/cycle |
| `user_subscriptions` | Active subscription per user (plan, status, purchased_screen_slots, Stripe IDs) |
| `pending_signups` | Temporary store for signups awaiting payment confirmation |

### Feature Permissions
`feature_permissions` maps `(plan_id, feature_key, is_enabled)` — controls which features are available per plan. Managed via the admin Feature Management page. Feature names are derived from `feature_key` (snake_case → Title Case). The public pricing page reads enabled features per plan from `/api/pricing/features`.

## Admin Panel (`/dashboard/admin/`)

Accessible only to super-admins (checked via `profiles.is_super_admin`). Includes:
- **User Management** — view all users, subscriptions, screen counts
- **Feature Management** — matrix of features × plans with toggle controls; add new features with per-plan enable/disable
- **Plan Management** — edit plan details and pricing
- **Audit Logs** — all admin actions logged to `admin_audit_logs`

## Auth Flow

1. **New user** → selects plan → pays via Stripe → webhook creates Supabase Auth user + profile + subscription → confirmation email sent
2. **Existing user login** → `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword` → session cookie → middleware validates on every request
3. **Password reset** → `/auth/forgot-password` sends reset email with link to `/auth/callback?next=/auth/reset-password` → Supabase exchanges code → user sets new password
4. **Password change** (in-app) → re-authenticates with current password first, then calls `supabase.auth.updateUser`

---

## File Storage (GCS)

All media and avatars are stored in Google Cloud Storage bucket `xkreen-web-app`. Files are uploaded server-side via the GCS XML API using a service account key (HMAC signing). Public URLs follow the pattern:
```
https://storage.googleapis.com/xkreen-web-app/[userId]/[timestamp]-[filename]
```
Avatar uploads go through `/api/profile/avatar` and the URL is saved to `profiles.avatar_url`.
